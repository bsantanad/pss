## what is a password in xkcd style?

## installation

build it yourself :)

with [rust][rust] and [cargo][cargo] installed just go ahead an clone the
repo and build it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bsantanad/pss pss.git
cd pss.git
cargo build --release
```
you might want to copy the `txt` files with the words into that dir
```bash
cp words-en.txt target/release/
cp words-es.txt target/release/
```
(**NOTE** this will be fix in the near future, to make a more friendly
approach)

If you want, you can make a link to your `/usr/bin`, this way you can use
it from wherever in your system.

For example, if you installed it in your home dir, you could do
```bash
ln -sf ~/pss.git/target/release/pss /usr/bin/
```

## usage
![example](images/exampl.png)

the most simple thing you can do is just
```bash
pss
```
this will build a password with the default ~350,000 english words, if you
want to change language to spanish you can do:
```bash
pss --lang es
```
You could also use your file of words
```bash
pss -f my_words.txt
```
If you don't want special chars in your password, there is a flag for that:
```bash
pss -s
```
of course, to see all the options, you can do:
```bash
pss --help
```
